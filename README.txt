This is a field line follower for the HSX geometry, it is designed to
follow field lines and check for termination on structures.

To run the code you need the coil files c1.dat through c6.dat, the auxiliary
coil files aux.dat and the vessel file, vessel.txt.  These are not hosted on
the github repository because of their large size.

This is a work in progress.
