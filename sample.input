!----Coils and geometry section----
!Number of periods, and whether to use mirror symmetry (1=yes, 0=no)
!For 4,1 (HSX) you only need to provide coils for 1/8 of the machine
!Right now, only 4,1 and 1,0 (no moving) are supported

! File for auxiliary coils
aux_icdiv.dat
! Number of aux coils (this needs to be the same or less than
! the first line in the aux coil file)
! The second number represents the number of windings in the main coils
! This is used for scaling purposes, the current in aux coils is:
! main_1 * taper_value * windings
6     14
! taper values for aux coils, if the aux coil value is 0, do
! not include any values here.  These are percentages relative
! to the current in the first main coil
